# Exploratory Data Analysis: Automobile Dataset

## Objective
This project explores automobile data to analyze **distributions, relationships, and trends** among engine characteristics, fuel type, and horsepower using **Python** and **Seaborn**.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`  
- `seaborn`  
- `matplotlib`

## Notebook Sections
1. **Univariate Analysis** – Explore distributions of individual variables  
2. **Bivariate Analysis** – Examine relationships between two continuous variables  
3. **Multivariate Analysis** – Compare multiple continuous variables at once  
4. **Categorical vs Continuous Analysis** – Explore how categorical variables relate to numerical variables  
5. **Multi-Panel Categorical Plots** – Visualize multiple categorical variables together  
6. **Linear Regression Analysis** – Identify linear trends and potential predictive relationships

## Observations / Key Insights
- Engine size and horsepower have a **strong positive correlation**  
- Most cars have **low horsepower**; a few outliers exist with very high values  
- **Gas vehicles dominate** the dataset; diesel vehicles are much fewer  
- **Body style** and **engine location** affect average horsepower  
- Linear trends exist, but they are **not strong enough for highly reliable predictions**

## Conclusion
This EDA project demonstrates how to:
- Compare distributions between **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate** variables  
- Create various types of plots for **categorical and continuous variables**  
- Build **multi-panel categorical factor plots** for deeper insights  
- Draw **linear regression plots** to visualize trends between continuous variables
